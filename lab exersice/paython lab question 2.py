#2.write a program reads the length of the base and the hight of a right angle triangle and print the area every number is given on a seperate line.
hight=float(input("enter the hight of the triangle"))
length=float(input("enter the length of the triangle"))
area=(hight*length)//2
#the float division // round the result down to the nearest whole nimber

print(f'the area of right angle triangle is{area}')
